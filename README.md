# SYNOPSIS
git module manager

# MOTIVATION
Simpler, faster, less complex dependency management!

Submodules receive much praise and criticism.Yet both depend on
the interpretation of how they should be used; `gmm` focuses
entirely on providing a workflow for dependency management.

Don't edit submodules â€” it's not an easy git workflow to manage.
This is also the basis of most submodule criticism. Instead, use
them as immutable dependencies, when you need changes, publish
them from upstream and simply re install using `gmm`.

# STATUS
Idea/Work in Progress

# INSTALL
You can just run this simple one-limer to install. The google-
shortened link points to the raw github user content (paste it
in the url-bar of your browser to verify). The sudo prompt for
your password is the chmod command asking for your permission
to make the file executable.

```bash
(curl -sL https://goo.gl/kS3VRE > /usr/local/sbin/gmm && sudo chmod 700 gmm)
```

# COMMANDS
There are only a handful, because really that's all you
should need. Here is some example output.

```
  git module manager v1.0.0

  usage: gmm <command> [options]

  commands:
    i, install [-v] <user/repo> [branch]
    u, uninstall <user/repo>
    ls [cache]

  options:
    --help, -h              show this help information
    --version               print the version number
    --update                self update
```

### INSTALL MODULES
Install first clones the repo to your `~/.modules` cache, then
adds it to your project from the cache.This is nice for
performance and offline usage.

Install will ensure your working tree is clean before adding a
submodule. Then, it will add the submodule (at the specified
branch, or master by default), then commit it for you.

Once your submodule is installed you will see a `modules`
directory in your project, these files will be flagged as read
only.

```
$ gmm i someorg/somerepo
[OK] pulled latest from git://github.com/someorg/somerepo.git
[INFO] using cached version
[OK] added the submodule
[OK] submodule installed
```

### LIST INSTALLED MODULES

```
$ myproject ls

[INFO] ðŸ“¦  foo@master in ./modules/someorg/foo
[INFO] ðŸ“¦  quxx@0.1.0 in ./modules/someorg/quxx

[OK] found 2 module(s) in myproject
```

### LIST CACHED MODULES
